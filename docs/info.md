## How it works
The Customizable PDM Pitch FIlter can filter a specific pitch and its harmonics from a PDM(Pulse Density Modulation) microphone input stream. First, the microphone signal is passed through a variable decimator. This alters the sample rate and allowsthe filtering of lower frquency waves. Second the signal is passed through a variable length moving average filter. Because the bitstream is in PDM format, (1 or -1 at 3.072 Mhz) it is possible to nullify a signal of specific freuqncy by passing the signal through a moving average filter of a specific length. Here is the calculations to find the filter length: `samplerate/target_frequency`. From there the output is passed through an I2S bus to an audio reciever. Additionally, the decimation ratio and filter length can be customized through an SPI port.


## How to test
### 1. Initial Setup
- **Connect Power Supply**
  - Ensure the module is correctly powered
- **Connect Clocks**
  - Connect a `3.072Mhz` clock to `clk`(`ui_in[0]`)
- **Connect Microphone**
  - Connect the microphone's `VCC` and `GND` pins to its respective sources
  - Connect its  `clk` pin to a `3.072Mhz` clock
  - Connect its  `data` pin to `mic_data`(`ui_in[3]`)
- **Connect I2S reciever**
  - Connect an I2S reciever of your choice like a configured Raspberry Pi or supported speaker to the `out` pin (`uo_out[0]`)
- **Connect SPI port**
  - Connect the `MOSI` wire to `spi_mosi`(`ui_in[1]`)
  - Connect the `CS_N` (Chip Select) wire to `spi_cs_n`(`ui_in[2]`)
  - Conect the other side of the SPI port to a microcontroller, Raspberry Pi or something  similar
### Configure Settings
- **Procedure**
  -  Set `CS_N` to low
  -  Set decimation ratio
    -  Pass in `8h00` then pass in the decimation ratio as 8 bits. Ex: `8h08` This should be a 16 bit input in total
  - Set `CS_N` to high
  - Wait at leaset 1 clock cycle and set `CS_N` to low
  - Set filter length
    -  Pass in `8h01` then pass in the filter length as 8 bits. Ex: `8h80` This should be a 16 bit input in total
### Monitor Output
- **Procedure**
  -  Enable I2S reciever
  -  Enable Clock Signals
  -  Record data from I2S reciever (Varies based on chosen reciever)
